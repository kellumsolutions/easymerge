EasyMerge is the ultimate Wordpress database merging tool.

== Description ==
EasyMerge is the ultimate Wordpress database merging tool. EasyMerge allows you to easily keep your production and development environments in sync, no matter how long the development environment is needed. EasyMerge will not overwrite your local changes when merging with the production site's database. EasyMerge is not compatible with multisite installations.

= How's It Work =
- **Install plugin on production site.** Activate the plugin with your license key, which can be generated directly through the plugin.
- **Clone the production site to the development site.** Use the Wordpress clone/migration plugin of your choice. Just ensure the development site is an exact clone of the production site.
- **Begin syncing with the production site.** Syncing the development site to the live site is as easy as the click of a button.
